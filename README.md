## Import/Export (Front End)
This is the front end for Import/Export - a text-based RPG web app game. You play the role of someone running a shipping company. With each loop of the game, you are faced with a potential customer and several options for how to handle each customer's proposition. Each choice has different effects on your stats throughout the game and can effect your financial well-being, your karma, and also your status in the eyes of the law. All of these stats affect the probabilities of certain events occurring throughout the game.

## Features
- Fully persistent game files automatically save your progress as you play
- User profiles using OAuth and JWT tokens for login
- Material-ui for the user interface
- React-router to mimic multiple pages on a single page application
- Adjustable models with multiple curves for RNG rolls

## Motivation for Import/Export
I had several motivations for creating this project. I wanted to:

- Learn more about creating an app with user profiles, login, and user-specific data
- Gain more experience with a user interface library
- Experience what it was like to design and balance probability models for game or program events

The amount of creative freedom allowed by creating a game was also very appealing.
