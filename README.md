## Bucketlist
Bucketlist is a project I did with a partner while attending the Flatiron bootcamp. This project was the culmination of our Ruby Rails module. It was interesting for me in retrospect because it was before we learned JavaScript, so the entire web app is in Ruby. Because of the lack of JavaScript, it was a little bit of a challenge to get it to feel like a modern website, but that also made it fun and interesting in many ways. This project taught me a lot about the Rails framework, and how to make views, templates, and forms using ERB.

## Features
- Full Ruby on Rails web application (no JavaScript used)
- Interactive forms and dynamic content
- User-uploaded images
- User rating system

## Motivation for Import/Export
The motivation for this project was to reinforce and practice the Rails concepts that we had learned in the previous module of the bootcamp. My project partner and I decided that an app like Bucketlist would be a good and fun way to do this.

## Made with:
