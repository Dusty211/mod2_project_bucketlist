## Bucketlist
Bucketlist is a project I did with a partner while attending the Flatiron bootcamp. This project was the culmination of our Ruby Rails module. It was interesting for me in retrospect because it was before we learned JavaScript, so the entire web app is in Ruby. Because of the lack of JavaScript, it was a little bit of a challenge to get it to feel like a modern website, but that also made it fun and interesting in many ways. This project taught me a lot about the Rails framework, and how to make views, templates, and forms using ERB.

## Features
- Full Ruby on Rails web application (no JavaScript used)
- Interactive forms and dynamic content
- User-uploaded images
- User rating system

## Motivation for Import/Export
I had several motivations for creating this project. I wanted to:

- Learn more about creating an app with user profiles, login, and user-specific data
- Gain more experience with a user interface library
- Experience what it was like to design and balance probability models for game or program events

The amount of creative freedom allowed by creating a game was also very appealing.

## Made with:

- [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)
